            Screaming fans were nowhere to be found at the 27th Annual Seacoast Open. But talk to throwers like Jeff Smith, who drove six hours from New Brunswick, and it seems like there’s no place they’d rather be.

            The USFL drew millions of fans and launched the careers of legends. But then it died beneath the weight of a particularly egotistical and bombastic owner &mdash; a New York businessman named Donald Trump.
